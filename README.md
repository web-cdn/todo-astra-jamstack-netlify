# JAMStack + Netlify + DataStax Astra + Apache Cassandra with React Router demo

This is a demo repository set up to a Serverless react based todo application
using a [DataStax Astra](https://astra.datastax.com/register) free tier database for storage in AWS. 

The project interacts directly with the database from the react based frontend application and can be deployed on Netlify for free with a few clicks.
